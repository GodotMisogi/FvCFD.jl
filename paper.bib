@article{Woodward1984,
	issn = {0021-9991},
	abstract = {Results of an extensive comparison of numerical methods for simulating hydrodynamics are presented and discussed. This study focuses on the simulation of fluid flows with strong shocks in two dimensions. By “strong shocks,” we here refer to shocks in which there is substantial entropy production. For the case of shocks in air, we therefore refer to {Mach} numbers of three and greater. For flows containing such strong shocks we find that a careful treatment of flow discontinuities is of greatest importance in obtaining accurate numerical results. Three approaches to treating discontinuities in the flow are discussed—artificial viscosity, blending of low- and high-order-accurate fluxes, and the use of nonlinear solutions to Riemann's problem. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed and illustrated by computed results for three test problems. In this comparison we have focused our attention entirely upon the performance of schemes for differencing the hydrodynamic equations. We have regarded the nature of the grid upon which such differencing schemes are applied as an independent issue outside the scope of this work. Therefore we have restricted our study to the case of uniform, square computational zones in Cartesian coordinates. For simplicity we have further restricted our attention to two-dimensional difference schemes which are built out of symmetrized products of one-dimensional difference operators.},

@article{Greenshields2010,
	abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

@article{Miller1985,
	abstract = {An experimental investigation of the lee-side flow on sharp leading-edge delta wings at supersonic speeds has been conducted. Pressure data were obtained at {Mach} numbers from 1.5 to 2.8, and three types of flow-visualization data (oil-flow, tuft, and vapor-screen) were obtained at {Mach} numbers from 1.7 to 2.8 for wing leading-edge sweep angles from 52.5 deg to 75 deg. From the flow-visualization data, the lee-side flows were classified into seven distinct types and a chart was developed that defines the flow mechanism as a function of the conditions normal to the wing leading edge, specifically, angle of attack and {Mach} number. Pressure data obtained experimentally and by a semiempirical prediction method were employed to investigate the effects of angle of attack, leading-edge sweep, and {Mach} number on vortex strength and vortex position. In general, the predicted and measured values of vortex-induced normal force and vortex position obtained from experimental data have the same trends with angle of attack, {Mach} number, and leading-edge sweep; however, the vortex-induced normal force is underpredicted by 15 to 30 percent, and the vortex spanwise location is overpredicted by approximately 15 percent.},
